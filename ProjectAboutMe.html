  <p>Hi my name is Emily and this is a little about me! Growing up I loved nothing more than playing video games with my dad and sister. From a young age, I was fascinated by the colorful worlds and thrilling adventures that could be found in the digital realm. As a child, I spent countless hours playing classic games like Legend of Zelda WindWaker and Animal Crowwing on my Nintendo GameCube. Experiencing this just grew my love of technology even more, my dad was an engineer so that was one of the career paths I thought of taking when I was young. I was always eager to discover new games and genres, and soon became an expert at JRPGs, role-playing games, and strategy games. I spent a lot of time playing an MMO called World of Warcraft with my dad and thats how I practiced my reading and spelling. I found that I could always come home from a tough day and playing video games helped me to relax and unwind after a long day at school. I loved the challenge of mastering new levels and quests. When I got into High School I realized there were so many people who loved video games as much as I did and they had online communities that I could join. I made friends with people from all over the world who shared my enthusiasm for gaming, and some have become decade old friends. Thanks to my dad I grew up loving technology and eventually making it my career!</p>

  <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">My Intrest Outside of Coding</h2>
<p class="sectionContent">I've always had a passion for video games ever since I was little, but I also played Dungeons and Dragons growing up too but no one I knew played it until I met some great friends in High School. Dungeons and Dragons typically involves a deep passion for the game and its unique blend of storytelling, strategy, and social interaction. Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game where players assume the roles of fictional characters and embark on adventures together, led by a game master who sets the scene and controls the world. Growing up my dad built my worlds, people, and creatures for me and my sister to explore. I'm so glad I fell inlove with it because it gave me some of my best friends for well over a decade. My love for being creative has never stopped and I hope it helps me in this field so I can keep doing what makes me happy.</p>
